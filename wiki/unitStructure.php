				The VVarMachine Combined Fleet uses a Hierarchical Military Unit Structure, with design elements incorporated from the organization of the US Navy, AirForce, and Marine Corps. In broad terms, our fleet is arranged into two branches <strong>(Divisions)</strong>. Our Military Division will focus on combat-related duties, and our Economic Division will focus on generating revenue to support the war-effort.

				<h4 class="WikiH4">Unit Types</h4>
				<h5 class="WikiH5">Squadrons & Platoons</h5>
				<div class="WikiText">
					Our Military Division is built using a unit-hierarchy system. The lowest-level of the tree, and smallest permanent units are <strong>Squadrons</strong> and <strong>Platoons</strong>. These units are commanded by Junior Officers (O-2, O-3, O-4). Each Squadron or Platoon will sortie one or more <strong>Flights</strong> or <strong>Squads</strong> for organized operations. These Flights/Squads are led by NCOs, but are not considered Permanent Units within the Fleet.
					<br />
					<br />
					For air units, a Flight normally consists of at least 2 ships, and the number of ships per Flight will vary based on the type of equipment operated by each Squadron during a particular operation. In some cases, especially with larger multi-crew ships, a single vessel may comprise the entire Flight.
					<br />
					<br />
					For ground units, a Platoon consists of 16 Members. Personnel include a Commanding Officer, a Senior-Enlisted (at least E-6) serving as the assistant Platoon Leader, and two 7-man Squads of Marine Operators, each lead by an E-5 or higher.
					<br />
					<br />
					Once a Squadron or Platoon has reached its Player Capacity (not yet defined for Squadrons), a sister-unit can be formed alongside it. This will generally be accomplished by offering an Officer Commission to the Assistant Squadron/Platoon Leader of the existing unit, and promoting another NCO (likely a Flight/Squad Leader into the role of Assistant for the existing Unit). The new leader will be promoted to O-1, and will serve as an apprentice and Assistant CO in his/her current unit before being placed in-command of the newly-created unit.
				</div>
				<h5 class="WikiH5">Air-Wings & Marine Special Warfare Teams</h5>
				<div class="WikiText">
					Moving up the hierarchy tree, we find the <strong>Air Wing</strong> and <strong>MSWT</strong> units. These units will only be established once there are at-minimum 3 Squadrons/Platoons existing below them, and there is a need for a parent-unit to be created for oversight in planning and operational execution. Due to constraints inherent to the numbering system described below, a single Air Wing can contain a maximum of 9 Squadrons. The Air Wing and Company units will be commanded by an Officer of at-least O-5 PayGrade, assisted by an O-4. Their command staff may also include additional Officers, and Senior NCOs serving as advisers.
				</div>
				<h5 class="WikiH5">Combat Groups</h5>
				<div class="WikiText">
					The next level in the tree holds the <strong>Combat Group</strong> units. These units are commanded by a Senior Officer (at least O-6 PayGrade), along with an O-5 Senior Officer serving as the unit's Executive Officer (XO) and second-in-command. In addition, one or more Senior NCO members may be assigned to the unit to serve as an adviser, or perform highly-specialized roles outside of the normal duties of the units below them. As is the case with lower units, the formation of a Combat Group will only take place when a minimum of 3 Air-Wings or MSWTs exist below them, and there is a need for a parent-unit to be created for oversight in planning and operational execution.
				</div>
				<h5 class="WikiH5">Division</h5>
				<div class="WikiText">
					Finally, we reach the level of the Division Headquarters (DIV HQ). While units at the level of Air Wing/MSWT, or Combat Group will not exist until needed, the DIV HQ is already established with leadership assigned. This means that any lower-level units will report directly to DIV HQ until the Fleet grows enough to create their immediate parent units. Each Division HQ is commanded by a Flag Officer (Admiral) of at-least O-7 PayGrade, who is assisted by a Senior Officer of at-least O-5 PayGrade. In addition, just like Combat Groups, Senior NCOs will be present and assigned as advisers or specialized operatives performing unconventional roles for their Division or the Fleet. DIV HQ may also include other Officers working in non-operational roles such as Intelligence, Finance, Public Relations, Recruitment, etc.

				<br />
				<h4 class="WikiH4">Unit Numbering and Naming</h4>
				<div class="WikiText">
					Larger-size units such as Combat Groups and Air Wings/MSWTs are numbered in the order they are created - meaning that the first Combat Group created within the Military Division will be numbered and named "1st Combat Group".
					<br />
					<br />
					For Air Wings, these are also numbered by type - examples of this are "1st Fighter Wing", "1st Bomber Wing", etc. There will be no reuse of these names within the Fleet. The second Fighter Wing established will be called the "2nd Fighter Wing", regardless of which Combat Group it belongs to.
					<br />
					<br />
					For Marine Special Warfare Teams, these are simply numbered in the order of creation, regardless of the Combat Group to which they belong. The examples would be "MSWT 1","MSWT 2", etc.
					<br />
					<br />
					Squadrons are named with a three-digit number, indicative of the Combat Group and Air Wing to which they belong. For example, the "112th Fighter Squadron" belongs to the 1st Combat Group, and the first Air Wing created within that group, regardless of the Wing's type (in this case, the "1st Fighter Wing"). Due to this numbering system, the maximum amount of Squadrons within an Air Wing is limited to 9 for confusion to be avoided, and for proper use of the three-digit system. For Example, the "2nd Combat Group" may contain the "1st Fighter Wing", "4th Bomber Wing", and "7th Combat Support Wing", with each Wing's Squadrons being numbered 211st through 219th, 221st through 229th, and 231st through 239th, respectively - note how the number assigned to the Air Wing has no impact on the Squadron's number. That 2nd digit is derived from the order of the Air Wings when they are created within the Combat Group. Based on this system, there can only be one Squadron within the entire Fleet with a given three-digit number.
					<br />
					<br />
					For Marine Platoons, these are numbered in-order of creation within an MSWT ("1st Platoon", "2nd Platoon", etc), where names will be reused between MSWTs.

					At this time, our Economic Division doesn't contain permanent Organizational Units (OrgUnits) like our Military Division. Due to the ECONDIV's primary responsibility being the financing and supply of our MILDIV Forces, the required tasks to be performed by the ECONDIV will vary with a high degree of frequency, based on the needs of the MILDIV at a given time. Despite this difference in organization, our ECONDIV will still utilize the <a href="http://sc.vvarmachine.com/wiki/?page=ranks">Rank Structure</a> defined for our Fleet, along with a certification system designed to identify members who have attained skills in particular areas of gameplay, and assign them into positions of leadership (both NCO and Officer positions) for commanding <a href="http://sc.vvarmachine.com/wiki/?page=operations">Operational Units</a> (OpUnits) during a given mission or campaign.
				</div>
				<h4 class="WikiH4">Economic Division Roles/Tasks</h4>
				<div class="WikiText">
					Players assigned to the ECONDIV may choose to identify themselves as a specialist in a certain area of gameplay, just like those in the MILDIV who have joined a permanent, specialized Squadron or Platoon. Some examples of these specialities are listed below:
					<br />
					<br />
					<ul class="WikiOL">
						<li>Mining, Resource Extraction, and Processing</li>
						<li>Exploration and Survey</li>
						<li>Materials Transport (both Finished Goods and Raw Materials)</li>
						<li>Science, Research, and Materials Crafting</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					Officers within the ECONDIV are primarily tasked with the Planning of Organized Operations, and oversight of the Fleet's finance system. Unlike the MILDIV Officers, those of the ECONDIV may not hold a speciality in a certain area of gameplay, and thus will not always be tasked with leading OpUnits for Missions of a certain type. As with the MILDIV, the size of the OpUnit will define the Rank/PayGrade of its designated Commander during the mission. In most cases during operations requiring cooperation from both Divisions, ECONDIV forces will fall under the command of a MILDIV Officer responsible for leading the <strong>Section</strong> or <strong>Task Force</strong> built to accomplish the given mission. This directive is put in-place to utilize the the advanced training given to MILDIV Officers, especially in regard to Asset Escort-Protocols for Fighters and Marines. In other words, once the ECONDIV Officer(s) have completed the planning for the Economic aspects of the Operation, their plans are turned-over to the MILDIV Officer(s) to plan and execute the allocation of members towards protection of the ECONDIV assets. Once the Operation launches, both ECONDIV and MILDIV commanders should be in-sync on the Economic Goals of mission, but the direct oversight of the ECONDIV assets will be assigned to the MILDIV commander of the OpUnit providing protection.

					Information on this system is being actively developed by ECONDIV HQ and will be forthcoming in the near future.
